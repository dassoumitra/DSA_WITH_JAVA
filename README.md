# DSA with Java – Day 3 Progress                                                                                                                                     DATE: 05/02/26

## 📌 Overview
This repository tracks my DSA with Java learning journey.  
Day 3 focuses on understanding loop constructs in Java, which are essential for logic building before solving DSA problems.

At this stage, the emphasis is on conceptual clarity, not problem count.

---

## 📅 Day 3 Focus
Topic: Java Loops (Conceptual Understanding)  
Status: Concepts understood, problem-solving pending

---

## 📚 Concepts Covered (Theory Only)

### 1. For Loop
- Syntax and execution flow
- Initialization, condition, increment/decrement
- Fixed-iteration problems

### 2. While Loop
- Entry-controlled loop
- Condition-based execution
- Infinite loop scenarios

### 3. Do-While Loop
- Exit-controlled loop
- Guaranteed single execution
- Difference from while loop

### 4. Break Statement
- Early termination of loops
- Logical exit conditions

### 5. Continue Statement
- Skipping current iteration
- Flow control inside loops

### 6. Nested Loops (Introduction)
- Loop inside another loop
- Iteration dependency

# 📘 Day 4 – While Loop Practice (Java)     Date: 06/02/26

## 🔹 Overview
On “Day 4”, I focused on mastering the “`while loop” in Java by solving “20 fundamental programming problems”.  
This practice strengthened my understanding of “iteration, number manipulation, condition checking, and basic algorithms”.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand how the `while` loop works internally
- Practice looping with counters and conditions
- Apply loops to solve mathematical and logical problems
- Improve problem-solving confidence without using advanced constructs

---

- Iterative logic using `while` loop
- Number traversal (forward & reverse)
- Even and odd number processing
- Summation techniques
- Digit-based operations
- Mathematical checks and series generation

---

## ✅ Problems Solved

1. Print numbers from “1 to 10”
2. Print numbers from “10 to 1”
3. Print all “even numbers (1–100)”
4. Print all “odd numbers (1–100)”

### ➗ Mathematical Operations
5. Print “multiplication table” of a number
6. Sum of first “n natural numbers”
7. Sum of all “even numbers up to n”
8. Sum of all “odd numbers up to n”
9. Find “factorial” of a number

### 🔁 Digit Manipulation
10. Product of digits of a number
11. Count total digits in a number
12. Reverse a number
13. Check “palindrome number”
14. Find “sum of digits”

### 🔍 Number Property Checks
15. Check “Armstrong number”
16. Check “Perfect number”
17. Print all “prime numbers (1–100)”
18. Check whether a number is “prime”

### 🔢 Series Problems
19. Print “Fibonacci series” up to n terms
20. Find “sum of Fibonacci series” up to n terms

---

## 🛠️ Concepts Strengthened
- Loop control using conditions
- Efficient use of variables
- Avoiding infinite loops
- Handling edge cases (`0`, `1`, negative numbers)
- Time & space complexity awareness

---

## 🚀 Key Learnings
- `while` loop is best when the number of iterations is “condition-based”
- Mathematical problems can be solved efficiently without arrays
- Breaking problems into “small logical steps” makes coding easier
- Clean logic matters more than short code
