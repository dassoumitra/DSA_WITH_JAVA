# 🚀 Java + DSA + Development Learning Journey                                                                                                               DATE : 02/02/26

This repository documents my “daily progress” in learning “Java fundamentals, DSA basics, and development concepts” for placement preparation.

The goal is to build a “strong foundation”, write “clean code”, and develop “logical problem-solving skills”.

# DSA with Java – Day 3 Progress                                                                                                                                     DATE: 04/02/26

## 📌 Overview
This repository tracks my DSA with Java learning journey.  
Day 3 focuses on understanding loop constructs in Java, which are essential for logic building before solving DSA problems.

At this stage, the emphasis is on conceptual clarity, not problem count.

---

## 📅 Day 3 Focus
Topic: Java Loops (Conceptual Understanding)  
Status: Concepts understood, problem-solving pending

---

## 📚 Concepts Covered (Theory Only)

### 1. For Loop
- Syntax and execution flow
- Initialization, condition, increment/decrement
- Fixed-iteration problems

### 2. While Loop
- Entry-controlled loop
- Condition-based execution
- Infinite loop scenarios

### 3. Do-While Loop
- Exit-controlled loop
- Guaranteed single execution
- Difference from while loop

### 4. Break Statement
- Early termination of loops
- Logical exit conditions

### 5. Continue Statement
- Skipping current iteration
- Flow control inside loops

### 6. Nested Loops (Introduction)
- Loop inside another loop
- Iteration dependency

---

## 🧠 Current Understanding
- Able to read and understand loop-based code
- Clear about loop flow and conditions
- Comfortable with syntax and control statements
- Still building confidence in solving problems independently

---

## ⚠️ What Is Not Done Yet
- Loop-based problem solving
- Coding practice from the PDF
- Pattern and series programs

---

## 🎯 Next Plan
- Start solving problems phase-wise from the PDF
- Begin with While Loop problems
- Focus on dry-run and logic building

---

## ⏳ Time Spent
- ~2–3 hours

---

## ✅ Day 3 Status
✔ Loop concepts understood  
❌ Problems not solved yet  
➡️ Ready to start implementation

---

## 📌 Note
Strong understanding of loops is the foundation for all upcoming DSA topics.

---

🚀 Progress over perfection.
