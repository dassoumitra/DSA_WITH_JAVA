## 🧠 Concepts Covered (Short Explanation)

- “What is a Method”  
  A method is a block of code that performs a specific task and runs only when it is called. It helps in code reusability and modularity.

- “Method Declaration and Definition”  
  Declaration specifies the method name, return type, and parameters, while definition contains the actual code to be executed.

- “Method Calling”  
  Method calling is the process of executing a method by using its name along with required arguments.

- “Return Type and `void` Methods”  
  The return type specifies the value a method sends back to the caller. `void` methods do not return any value.

- “Method Parameters and Arguments”  
  Parameters are variables defined in the method, while arguments are actual values passed during method calls.

- “Passing Values to Methods”  
  Java passes arguments by value, meaning a copy of the variable is sent to the method.

- “Scope of Variables”  
  Variable scope defines where a variable can be accessed (local, method-level, or class-level).

- “Static Methods”  
  Static methods belong to the class and can be called without creating an object of the class.

- “Method Overloading (Basic Idea)”  
  Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in the same class.

---

## 🔁 Types of Methods Studied (Short Explanation)

- “User-Defined Methods”  
  Methods created by the programmer to perform specific tasks.

- “Methods with Parameters”  
  These methods accept input values to process data dynamically.

- “Methods with Return Values”  
  Methods that return a result to the calling method using the `return` keyword.

- “Void Methods”  
  Methods that perform actions but do not return any value.

- “Static Methods”  
  Methods that can be called directly using the class name without creating an object.

- “Overloaded Methods”  
  Methods having the same name but different parameter lists to perform similar tasks.
________________________________________
 

## 🔁 Method vs Function

| Basis | Method | Function |
|------|--------|----------|
| Definition | A method is a block of code associated with a class or object | A function is a block of code independent of any class |
| Programming Style | Object-Oriented Programming | Procedural Programming |
| Belongs To | Always belongs to a class | Exists independently |
| Support in Java | Java supports methods only | Java does not support standalone functions |
| Calling Style | Called using object name or class name | Called directly using function name |
| Access Modifiers | Can use access modifiers (public, private, etc.) | Access modifiers are not supported |
| Example Languages | Java, C++, Python (methods) | C, C++, Python (functions) |
| Reusability | Achieved through objects and classes | Achieved through function calls |
