## 🧠 Concepts Covered (Short Explanation)

- “What is a Method”  
  A method is a block of code that performs a specific task and runs only when it is called. It helps in code reusability and modularity.

- “Method Declaration and Definition”  
  Declaration specifies the method name, return type, and parameters, while definition contains the actual code to be executed.

- “Method Calling”  
  Method calling is the process of executing a method by using its name along with required arguments.

- “Return Type and `void` Methods”  
  The return type specifies the value a method sends back to the caller. `void` methods do not return any value.

- “Method Parameters and Arguments”  
  Parameters are variables defined in the method, while arguments are actual values passed during method calls.

- “Passing Values to Methods”  
  Java passes arguments by value, meaning a copy of the variable is sent to the method.

- “Scope of Variables”  
  Variable scope defines where a variable can be accessed (local, method-level, or class-level).

- “Static Methods”  
  Static methods belong to the class and can be called without creating an object of the class.

- “Method Overloading (Basic Idea)”  
  Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in the same class.

---

## 🔁 Types of Methods Studied (Short Explanation)

- “User-Defined Methods”  
  Methods created by the programmer to perform specific tasks.

- “Methods with Parameters”  
  These methods accept input values to process data dynamically.

- “Methods with Return Values”  
  Methods that return a result to the calling method using the `return` keyword.

- “Void Methods”  
  Methods that perform actions but do not return any value.

- “Static Methods”  
  Methods that can be called directly using the class name without creating an object.

- “Overloaded Methods”  
  Methods having the same name but different parameter lists to perform similar tasks.
________________________________________
 

## 🔁 Method vs Function

| Basis | Method | Function |
|------|--------|----------|
| Definition | A method is a block of code associated with a class or object | A function is a block of code independent of any class |
| Programming Style | Object-Oriented Programming | Procedural Programming |
| Belongs To | Always belongs to a class | Exists independently |
| Support in Java | Java supports methods only | Java does not support standalone functions |
| Calling Style | Called using object name or class name | Called directly using function name |
| Access Modifiers | Can use access modifiers (public, private, etc.) | Access modifiers are not supported |
| Example Languages | Java, C++, Python (methods) | C, C++, Python (functions) |
| Reusability | Achieved through objects and classes | Achieved through function calls |

On **Day 16** of my **DSA with Java** journey, I studied **Arrays in Java**, one of the most fundamental data structures in programming.  
This session focused on understanding what arrays are, how they work internally, and how they are used to solve basic DSA problems efficiently.

Arrays form the foundation for many advanced data structures and algorithms.

## 🧠 What Are Arrays?
An **array** is a data structure that stores a fixed number of elements of the **same data type** in contiguous memory locations.  
Each element can be accessed using an **index**, starting from `0`.

---
## why Array index start from '0'
Array indexing starts from 0 because the index represents the offset from the base memory address of the array. The first element is stored at the base address itself, so its offset is zero, which makes memory access faster and simpler.
---

## 🔑 Why Arrays Are Important
- Store multiple values in a single variable
- Fast access using index
- Simplifies handling large amounts of data
- Foundation for advanced topics like matrices, sorting, searching, stacks, and queues

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Array declaration and initialization
- Accessing array elements using index
- Traversing arrays using loops
- Fixed size nature of arrays
- Difference between primitive and reference arrays
- Memory allocation in arrays
- Basic array operations

---

## 🔁 Common Operations on Arrays
- Traversal
- Updating elements
- Finding sum and average
- Finding minimum and maximum values
- Searching elements using loops

---

## 💡 Key Learnings
- Array index starts from `0`
- Array size is fixed once created
- Loops are commonly used to process arrays
- Arrays improve efficiency and code clarity
- Understanding arrays is essential for mastering DSA

---

## 📘 Example (Array Declaration)

## java
int[] arr = new int[5];
